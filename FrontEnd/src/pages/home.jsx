        <p>Aww you wanna know about me?</p>
        <p>
          Well I am an avid movie collector/watcher, mostly 4k. I know enough
          about cars to get myself in trouble when I (try to) fix them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Been married for a few years, have some amazing kids, all grown up
          now. And currently the best wife in the world, no...you can't have
          her.

          I also feel like, my site is never 'ready', partially due to not
          having much artistic skill, and when you do something for a living you
          never get time to work on your own thing. Example: Mechanic with a
          busted ride, or a house painter whos house needs painting, that sort
          of thing.
